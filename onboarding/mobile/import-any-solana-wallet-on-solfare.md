# Import any Solana Wallet on solfare

Importing your existing Solana wallet into Solflare allows you to manage your assets within Solflare's user-friendly interface. You can do this using either your wallet's **private key** or **recovery phrase**.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important:** Your private key and recovery phrase are sensitive pieces of information that grant full access to your funds. Handle them with utmost care and ensure they remain confidential.
{% endhint %}

_**Below are step-by-step instructions for both methods.**_

***

## **Method 1: Importing Using a Private Key**

* Click on the **Settings** icon (usually located at the bottom right).
* Navigate to **Manage Accounts** and select **Show Private Key**.
* Enter your wallet password when prompted.
* Your private key will be displayed; copy it securely.

### **2. Import into Solflare:**

## **Method 2: Importing Using a Recovery Phrase**

{% hint style="warning" %}
_Note: This method is suitable if your current wallet does not provide access to the private key but offers a recovery phrase (also known as a mnemonic phrase)._
{% endhint %}

### **1. Obtain the Recovery Phrase from Your Current Wallet:**

* Open your existing Solana wallet.
* Access the **Settings** menu.
* Locate the option to **Export Recovery Phrase**.
