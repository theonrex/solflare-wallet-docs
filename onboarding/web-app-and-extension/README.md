# Web App & Extension

### **What is Solflare Wallet Web App & Extension?**

Solflare’s Web App and Extension are powerful non-custodial wallets designed to provide seamless access to the Solana blockchain. Launched in late 2020, these products were the first offerings from the Solflare team and quickly gained widespread credit. At their peak, they facilitated over $20 billion in staked Solana tokens, accounting for more than 25% of all staked Solana at the time.

These platforms serve as the foundation for Solflare’s growth, establishing it as one of the most versatile and user-friendly wallets on Solana. Both the Web App and Extension empower users with full control over their assets while delivering advanced features to enhance the Solana experience.
