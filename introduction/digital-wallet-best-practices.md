# Digital Wallet Best Practices

### **Safety First**

When using your wallet for multiple purposes, it's advisable to set up separate wallets for different activities. This approach enhances security and helps you manage your assets more effectively.

### **Protecting Your Recovery Phrase**

Upon creating a new Solflare wallet, you'll receive a **24-word** recovery phrase. This phrase is important for accessing your wallet and should be kept confidential. Ensure that only you know this phrase and that it remains secure at all times.

### **Secure Storage Methods**

The way you store your mnemonic phrase depends on your preferences, but for maximum security, we recommend this method:

**Write it down on paper**

* Write your mnemonic phrase on paper and store it in a secure, offline location, such as a safe or safety deposit box.
* You can create multiple copies for backup, but make sure they remain private and protected from theft, damage, or loss.

This offline storage method minimizes exposure to online threats and provides the highest level of security. While there are other storage options available, this is the safest approach we recommend.

### **Additional Tips**
