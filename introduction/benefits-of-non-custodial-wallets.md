# Benefits of Non-Custodial Wallets

Non-custodial wallets give you direct control over your assets, as long as the blockchain they reside on is operational. These wallets are your gateway to Web3, enabling you to trade digital assets like tokens and NFTs, interact with decentralized applications (dApps), participate in DeFi protocols for lending or staking, vote on governance proposals, and even engage in on-chain activities like perpetual futures contracts.&#x20;

With a non-custodial wallet, you hold the keys to a wide range of blockchain-powered opportunities.

### Non-custodial wallets empower you to:

* **Maintain Full Control Over Your Assets**: By holding your private keys, you have complete ownership and authority over your cryptocurrencies, eliminating reliance on third parties.
* **Enhance Security**: With no intermediaries holding your private keys, the risk of hacks or breaches affecting your assets is significantly reduced.
* **Ensure Privacy**: Non-custodial wallets often do not require personal information, allowing for more private transactions.
* **Achieve Censorship Resistance**: You can transact freely without fear of interference or restrictions from centralized authorities.
* **Access Advanced Features:** Many non-custodial wallets offer functionalities like integration with decentralized applications (dApps), which enhance the crypto experience.

While non-custodial wallets give you full control, they also come with significant responsibilities:

1. **Protect Your Recovery Phrase:**\
   Your mnemonic or recovery phrase is the key to accessing your wallet. Losing it means permanently losing your funds, as no one, not even the wallet provider, can recover them.
2. **Beware of Phishing and Malicious Links:**\
   If you connect your wallet to an untrustworthy website or click on a phishing link, a malicious actor could drain your wallet entirely.
3. **Stay Vigilant:**\
   Your wallet's security is in your hands. It is crucial to follow best practices and stay informed about digital security.
