# The Power of Self-Custody

With Solflare, you can take full control of your digital assets through **self-custody**. This is a secure and independent way to manage your crypto without relying on intermediaries like exchanges or banks.

Self-custody is made possible with **non-custodial wallets**, which store your assets directly on the blockchain and provide you with full ownership. This approach offers significant benefits, including enhanced security, accessibility, and independence.

Depending on your financial situation and location, the advantages of self-custody can range from convenience to necessity. Whether you're in a developed country or an emerging market, Solflare is designed to support your needs.

### **Why is Self-Custody Important?**

Self-custody can be very helpful depending on where you live and your financial needs. For some people, it’s all about having more independence. For others, especially in places with restricted access to Centralized exchanges, it’s a vital tool for financial freedom. Wherever you are, Solflare is here to help you manage your assets safely and easily.

### **Custodial vs. Non-Custodial Wallets**

* **Custodial Wallet**: When you open an account with a centralized exchange (like Coinbase or Binance), you’re using a custodial wallet. This means the exchange holds your funds for you, and you trust them to keep your money safe. However, during busy market times, exchanges may freeze trading or withdrawals, meaning you can’t access your funds when you need them.
* **Non-Custodial Wallet**: A non-custodial wallet, like the Solflare wallet, is a **blockchain account** that you control completely. This means your funds are always on the blockchain (a secure, digital ledger), and no one, except you, can access them. It’s like keeping your money in a safe that only you have the key to.

### **How Does It Work?**

[Non-custodial wallets](https://academy.solflare.com/what-are-non-custodial-wallets/) use public and private key cryptography to secure your funds. The public key functions as your wallet address, where others send funds. The private key is the most critical piece, as it grants full control over your wallet. If someone gains access to it, they can drain your funds instantly, making it crucial to keep it safe and never share it.

To ensure backup, you’re also given a **mnemonic phrase**, a secret set of words that lets you recover your wallet if you lose access. Even better, one mnemonic phrase can manage multiple wallets, giving you full control over your crypto assets.

Its important to note that you can access a near infinite amount of blockchain accounts/wallets from a single mnemonic phrase.
