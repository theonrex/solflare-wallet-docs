# Order of JSON Fields

#### **Solflare JSON File Structure Recommendations**

Solflare provides users with a direct link to a JSON file, and to maintain proper readability and consistency, it's recommended to keep the order of fields the same as in the reference provided by Solflare. This ensures that the contents of the JSON file remain clear and easily interpretable by both humans and applications.

#### **Suggestions for Storing Data**

* **Fields**: Stick to the field order as shown in the reference to ensure human readability.
* **Arbitrary Data**: Use the `properties` field to store any other arbitrary data that specialized applications may use.

#### **Expanding the Standard**

If your project would benefit from expanding this standard in any way, Solflare encourages you to reach out and share your suggestions.
