# API Endpoints

Apart from the dashboard, we provide **API** endpoints that let apps integrate notifications in their own custom business flows. For example, you can query and monitor the blockchain so that if any business logic condition is triggered, you can dispatch a unicast (ex: "You are about to be liquidated") or broadcast (ex: "A new NFT drop coming up").

**API Key can be found inside the dashboard**
