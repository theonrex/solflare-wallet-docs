# Receiving Notifications

Users can receive push notifications sent by apps. All notifications get sent to targeted public keys, and users of those public keys will receive notifications simultaneously through all their devices that have notifications enabled.

For example, suppose a user uses both Solflare Web Extension and Soflare Mobile with duplicate public keys. In that case, they can subscribe to an app's notifications through Solflare Web Extension. When an app sends a notification, the user will get that notification both on their computer and mobile device.

Users can still subscribe to an app's notification even if they have not yet enabled notifications on their devices. Still, they won't receive any messages until notifications are allowed on one of their devices.
