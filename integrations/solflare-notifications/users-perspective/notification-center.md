# Notification Center

Users are able to receive an assortment of notifications sent by apps.

All notifications are sent to targeted keys, and users of those keys will get notifications simultaneously through all of their devices that have notifications enabled and toggled on in their Notification Center.

If a user has not yet enabled desktop notifications on their devices, they can subscribe to an app's notification and the notifications will still be shown in their Notification Center.

An image and a link can be embedded in the message. When the user clicks on the message a new tab will open with the provided link.â€‹
